        Price values can be selected by dragging the bullet to the desired position. This is
        possible by getting the axis position (which is returned in px
        using Cdk Drag & Drop function from Angular Material)
        and then calculating its proportion to the given Min and Max values.
        This value is binded to its corresponding label.<br>
        Values can be also edited manually introducing the price by input.
        With the same logic we can get an 'x' px position by calculating the values
        with a simple rule of three.<br>
        To prevent bullets from crossing there are two different invisible div axis
        with widths determined by each bullet position.
